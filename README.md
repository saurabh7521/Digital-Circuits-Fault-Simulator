# Digital-Circuits-Fault-Simulator
A simple logic simulator that will evolve into a fault simulator and test generator. Currently Parses netlist files (with INPUT/OUTPUT lists and gate definitions) and simulates gate-level behavior using a linked-list of gates.. Supports standard logic gates (AND, OR, NAND, NOR, INV, BUF, XOR) and produces inputâ€“output vectors for given test cases.
